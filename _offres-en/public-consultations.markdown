      <h2>WHAT IS A PUBLIC CONSULTATION?</h2>

      <p>A <b>public consultation</b> is an attempt at involving citizens in any public decision-making process. It must follow certain rules, such as starting in the early stages of decision-making and being as broad and inclusive as possible. Finally, a public consultation requires transparency and should be reviewed regularly.</p>

        <h2>Support & consulting</h2>
<p>A consultation process must <b>be facilitated and brought to life</b>. This requires time as well as <b>specific skills</b> (content creation, newsletters, collective intelligence workshops). It can be tricky to find internal resources, that is why we created this <b>tailor made support & consulting offer</b> which we can provide to your services</p>
