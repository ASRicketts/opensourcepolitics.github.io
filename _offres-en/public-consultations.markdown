#### WHAT IS A PUBLIC CONSULTATION?

A <b>public consultation</b> is an attempt at involving citizens in any public decision-making process. It must follow certain rules, such as starting in the early stages of decision-making and being as broad and inclusive as possible. Finally, a public consultation requires transparency and should be reviewed regularly.

#### SEVERAL TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE.

We offer several types of platforms. We orient our partners towards one of them according to their specific needs.

[**Democracy OS**](https://dos.demo.osp.cat), is a very simple tool built for online debate and e-voting that facilitates public consultation on any topic. This tool’s uncluttered interface allows the platform to be accelerated by its users (administrators and citizens).

[**Consul**](http://www.decide.es/en/index.html), on the other hand, makes it possible to send ideas or proposals from the citizens. 

#### PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT.

In order for these processes to be successful, namely making them inclusive and making sure they generate as many proposals as possible from participants, we conduct workshops to present and demonstrate the value of public consultations. We organized such meetings in partnership with “La Suite dans les Idées” which is a consulting agency, at the Mayor of the 18th arrondissement of Paris, but also in Sevran or for the Solidel network, which is affiliated to the “Mutuelle sociale agricole”.
