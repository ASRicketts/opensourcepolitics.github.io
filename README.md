OSP Corporate Site
====================

This static website is built using jekyll and is hosted on Github pages. We used the Agency theme based on [Agency bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/templates/agency/) to create our own version.

# Pages added :

We didn't use the modal option for post display used by the agency theme. We needed to display real content so we created a post layout for our [references](https://github.com/OpenSourcePolitics/opensourcepolitics.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/refs.html) and [products](https://github.com/OpenSourcePolitics/opensourcepolitics.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/outils.html) information that's based on layout created by [Arthur Koenig](https://github.com/arthur-koenig) for the website [opendemocracynow.net](http://opendemocracynow.net). 

# img-assets :

The sketch file located in /img called img-assets can be used to create new post for products and references that will display well on the homepage. 

Anyhow :
A portfolio thumbnail is 1202x710px
A product logo is 884x884px

# How to use
