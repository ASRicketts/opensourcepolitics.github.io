We helped the [French Digital Agency](http://agencedunumerique.gouv.fr/) (Ministry of Economy, Industry and Digital Technology) setup a [consultation platform](https://article69.agencedunumerique.gouv.fr/) which aimed at highlighting “guidelines for a national development of digital practices within territories “. This was part of the recommendations of Bill 69 for a Digital Republic.

The Digital Agency is the first case of a French administration using the OGP Toolbox portal [ogptoolbox.org]. This was done in order to launch a consultation on a Democracy OS platform, which was built by Open Source Politics.

This process ended up keeping records of over 200 contributions on the platform. 25 workshops were also held to gather face to face proposals from 228 citizens.
