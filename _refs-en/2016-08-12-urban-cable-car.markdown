At the end of the year 2019, the "CINOR" (North Réunion Intercommunal Community) will deliver the new urban cable that is to connect several neighborhoods of Saint-Denis. The CINOR is seeking to pinpoint the best route for the cable car by collecting the residents opinions. In order to increase participation to this process, a consulting agency called "La Suite Dans les Idées" has asked us to formulate a digital engagement strategy, especially regarding the fact that the cable car could stop near the University, which might be an interesting option for the students.
