The member states of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) commit every two years on a national action plan. Etalab decided to open a public consultation during the conception phase of the 2017-2019 action plan. To do so, they chose Democracy OS which is an open source tool [https://gouvernement-ouvert.etalab.gouv.fr/topic/58f8b270dac46f831ad9196b]. OSP staff members took part in the configuration of this platform and the development of the new consultation generated data export functions.

There were around 100 users, who published over 80 contributions discussing the four topics: Government Accountability; Public Consultation; Open Data and Open Government.

These contributions are meant to nurture the preparation of commitments which, in the future, will be submitted for consultation as well. They are an addition to the actions of the 2015-2017 action plan and the recommendations of a committee of independent experts.
