Before asking ourselves which tool an institution needs, we tend to look around, see what people do abroad. For example, we’ve been very inspired by what they do in Madrid. In November, [Virgile spent two weeks at Medialab Prado](https://medium.com/open-source-politics/quinze-jours-en-immersion-dans-le-civic-hall-europ%C3%A9en-%C3%A0-madrid-8317299829f9) and told us about this place’s formula, where the managing team collaborates with activists to produce digital commons for the greater good. At the core of this civic initiative, is [Consul](http://www.decide.es/en/) which is an open source platform that allows civic votations, participatory budgeting as well as calls for projects.
In March, we proudly launched the participatory budgeting platform of “la Régie Immobilière de la Ville de Paris” (RIVP): budget-participatif.rivp.fr!
This was a first time for both us, collaborating on the field with our partner [Copas](http://copas.coop/), and a [social landlord implementing an online participatory budgeting tool](https://www.budget-participatif.rivp.fr/). It was also the first time for our OSP Budget offer which revolves around Consul.
