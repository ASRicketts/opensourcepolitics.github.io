Yan Chantrel is the Socialist Party candidate for the French constituency abroad, which includes Canada and the United States. His campaign team contacted us in the summer of 2016 to launch a consultation on the “progressives project” that the candidate intends to embody during the June 2017 legislative election.

In conjunction with his Montreal-based collaborators, we deployed and adapted an instance of the Democracy OS platform, which hosted 30 debates, a hundred contributions and more than 700 votes.
